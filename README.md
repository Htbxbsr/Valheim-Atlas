## Overview

Valheim Atlas is a **read-only analysis and visualization tool** for Valheim servers.

It helps server operators understand how their world is actually used over time:
where players concentrate, how movement flows across the map,
and how persistent world load evolves as the server grows.

Valheim Atlas does **not** change gameplay, balance, mechanics, or progression.
It only observes, aggregates, and visualizes server-side data.

---

## Use Case

Valheim Atlas is designed for **server administrators and operators** who want
long-term visibility into world activity and load patterns.

Typical questions Valheim Atlas helps answer:

- Where do players concentrate during peak hours?
- Which areas of the world accumulate high ZDO density?
- How does player movement flow between regions?
- How does world load evolve over days or weeks?
- Are there emerging hotspots caused by building or activity clustering?

The tool is especially useful for:
- Persistent or long-running servers
- Community build worlds
- Performance and stability observation
- Historical analysis (without wipes)

---

## System Architecture

Valheim Atlas consists of three components that form a simple, one-directional pipeline:

1. **Server Plugin**  
   A lightweight BepInEx plugin emits telemetry data from the Valheim server.

2. **Aggregator**  
   A Python-based process aggregates raw events into time-based frames
   and prepares them for visualization.

3. **Static Web Viewer**  
   A browser-based viewer renders maps, overlays, and timelines
   from the aggregated data.

Data always flows in one direction:

Valheim Server → Plugin → Aggregator → Static Viewer


There is no live server interaction and no client-side dependency.

---

## Plugin Installation (BepInEx)

The Valheim Atlas plugin is distributed as a **prebuilt DLL via GitHub Releases**.

### Installation

1. Download the latest plugin DLL from the GitHub Releases page
2. Place the DLL into:

```
BepInEx/plugins/
```

3. Restart the Valheim server

The plugin:
- has no in-game UI
- does not affect gameplay
- only emits telemetry data

---

## Aggregator

The aggregator is a Python script that:
- reads emitted telemetry data
- groups events into time buckets
- produces frame-based JSON outputs
- maintains lightweight health and state metadata

It is designed to:
- run alongside the server
- fail safely (no hard crashes)
- regenerate derived data from existing frames

See:
 `docs/Data_Streams_Explanation/Aggregator_Explanation.md`
 `docs/DEBUG_RUNBOOK.md`

## Aggregator Input Configuration

By default, the Valheim Atlas aggregator expects its input data in a local
input/ directory relative to its working directory.

However, the Valheim Atlas server plugin writes telemetry data to the following
location by default:

```
BepInEx/config/heatflow/
```


This means one of the following setups is required at startup.

Option 1: Pass input directory explicitly (recommended)

Run the aggregator with an explicit input path pointing to the plugin output:

```
python aggregator.py --input /path/to/Valheim/BepInEx/config/heatflow
```
Option 2: Symlink or copy data into input/

Create a symlink or periodically copy the plugin output directory
into the aggregator's expected input/ directory.

Linux / Unix:
```
ln -s /path/to/Valheim/BepInEx/config/heatflow ./input
```

Windows (directory junction):
```
mklink /J input C:\path\to\Valheim\BepInEx\config\heatflow
```

The default behavior is intentional to keep the aggregator decoupled from any
specific Valheim or BepInEx installation.

The aggregator does not modify input data.
It only reads and aggregates existing telemetry files.

### Map Data (Base Map & Locations)

Valheim Atlas uses a static world map image as the base layer for all visualizations.
Map and location data are not generated by Valheim Atlas.

Recommended Source: valheim-map.world

Use valheim-map.world with your world seed to generate:

Base map image (recommended: 8192×8192) → map.png

All map data / locations export → map.json and locations.json

## Required Files (Viewer)

Valheim Atlas expects the following files:

```out/map.png
out/index.html
out/viewer.data.js
out/viewer.render.js
out/viewer.tile.worker.js
out/viewer.ui.js
```

### Map Data Placement

Place exported map data under:

```
out/map/data/
```

Expected structure:
```
out/
├─ index.html
├─ map.png                      # base map image (recommended 8192×8192)
├─ viewer.data.js
├─ viewer.render.js
├─ viewer.tile.worker.js
├─ viewer.ui.js
└─ map/
   └─ data/
      ├─ map.json               # map metadata (from valheim.world export)
      ├─ locations.json         # named locations (optional but recommended)
      └─ tiles/                 # optional tiles (if used by your viewer setup)
```

### Directory Creation

The viewer does not create directories automatically.

The following directories must exist before placing map data:
```
out/map/data/
```

If they do not exist, create them manually:
```
mkdir -p out/map/data
```

On Windows:
```
mkdir out\map\data
```

Only after the directories exist, place map.json, locations.json
and the optional tiles/ folder into
```
out/map/data/.
```
### Notes

The map image is a static reference layer used for visualization only.

Valheim Atlas does not validate or modify map data.

Correct generation/export is the responsibility of the server operator.

## Viewer

The viewer is a **static web application** (HTML + JavaScript).

It supports:
- live and historical playback
- heatmaps and activity overlays
- time-based navigation
- layered visualization modes

No backend server is required.
Opening `index.html` in a browser is sufficient.

### Viewer Controls

The viewer allows inspection of server activity using:
- timeline controls
- overlay toggles
- map layers
- density and flow visualizations
- a top-left Players HUD (frame-scoped; click a name to center)

## Repository Scope

This repository contains:
- Aggregator scripts
- Static web viewer
- System and data format documentation

The **plugin binary** is distributed via GitHub Releases.
The repository does **not** include:
- Valheim binaries

---

## Data Formats (Reference)

The following documents describe internal data formats and states.
They are intended for **advanced users and developers**:

- Player positions
- Player flow states
- Hotspot states
- Performance maps

- a gameplay modification
- a server replacement
- a performance optimization mod
- a live admin control tool

Its sole purpose is **observation and visualization**.
